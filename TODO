TODO
* 2+ order markov chains
* unit test suite
* complete INSTALL doc
* further oscillators: sine, saw, pulse
* better support for debug output and propagation between classes
* Pkey (see SC)
* improved OSC output 
* more random distributions (levy, beta, gamma)
* add parameter to MidiIn/MidiOut for device name
* exceptions when a finite operation is performed on an infinite series
* PRotate: move items from start to end of finite series (Spiegel 1981, #3)
* implement reset() for all finite sequences, and ensure it percolates through ops
  (to test: ensure that values() can be called twice in a row)
* introduce generic Pattern representation as chromosome (for EvoWorkshops?)
   -> generic breeding
   -> generic midpoint
* support for reverse-direction timelines
  (though may be tricky: how to handle nondeterministic patterns?)

DONE
* phasing example (with fractional durations)
* BUG: is something broken with noteOff/gate?
* PSubsequence: select subsequence with a given offset and length
  (with support for PWhite for random offsets, Spiegel 1981 #8)
* PArp (taking a Chord or Scale as input)
* PMap: map function over input pattern
* PConcat: concatenate sequences
* PReverse: reverse a finite series (after Spiegel 1981, #2)
* PLoopThenReset: loop input N times, then send reset()
* re-implement time warping 
* time jitter/phase (to implement both in Clock and Timeline)
* PNorm: normalization [0..1]
* auto-generated docs from comments
* move from osc to OSC module
* support for MIDI file reading
