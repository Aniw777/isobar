TODO
* re-implement time warping 
* time jitter (to implement both in Clock and Timeline)
* support for reverse-direction timelines
  (though may be tricky: how to handle nondeterministic patterns?)
* Pkey (see SC)
* OSC output 
* more random distributions (levy, beta, gamma)
* add parameter to MidiIn/MidiOut for device name
* exceptions when a finite operation is performed on an infinite series
* PRotate: move items from start to end of finite series (Spiegel 1981, #3)
* "manipulation of musical patterns" examples
* implement reset() for all finite sequences, and ensure it percolates through ops
  (to test: ensure that values() can be called twice in a row)
* introduce generic Pattern representation as chromosome (for EvoWorkshops?)
   -> generic breeding
   -> generic midpoint

DONE
* phasing example (with fractional durations)
* BUG: is something broken with noteOff/gate?
* PSubsequence: select subsequence with a given offset and length
  (with support for PWhite for random offsets, Spiegel 1981 #8)
* PArp (taking a Chord or Scale as input)
* PMap: map function over input pattern
* PConcat: concatenate sequences
* PReverse: reverse a finite series (after Spiegel 1981, #2)
