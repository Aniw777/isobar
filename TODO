TODO
* exceptions when a finite operation is performed on an infinite series
* PReverse: reverse a finite series (after Spiegel 1981, #2)
* PRotate: move items from start to end of finite series (Spiegel 1981, #3)
* manipulation of musical patterns example
* PSubsequence: select subsequence with a given offset and length
  (with support for PWhite for random offsets, Spieel 1981 #8)
* implement reset() for all finite sequences, and ensure it percolates through ops
  (to test: ensure that values() can be called twice in a row)

DONE
* phasing example (with fractional durations)
